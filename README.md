# GQM-Scrumble-evaluation

I provide a virtualized version of Scrumble game, using Microsoft Excel software.
The game can be played both virtual or physical, the complete kit with the game manual and the elements can be found here: http://scrumble.pyxis-tech.com/

PLAY HINTS

After the download of the excel file, create a copy so that the ready-to-play game model is not modified.

When you want to discard a card from the three decks, you just have to delete the row and the new card will automatically switch. I suggest to use the 300% zoom so that the players do not see the next cards.
